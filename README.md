# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML- and Scikit Learn
In this repo,  we will consolidate several machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using two popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. We will be using the Snap ML library that can accelerate popular Machine Learning algorithms through system awareness, and hardware/software differentiation.
